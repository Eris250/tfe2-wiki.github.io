The Alien House is a house in The Final Earth 2. It is unlocked by fully exploring an alien ruin.

# Strategy

Coming from a random discovery from alien ruins, Alien Houses are some of the best houses in the game, even rivaling the Villa. It houses an impressive number of people, is quite cheap, and can easily get 100 quality if you get the Living Research Center upgrades. However, make sure you have adequate food production, as your citizens can easily fall to starvation if you build too much of these.
