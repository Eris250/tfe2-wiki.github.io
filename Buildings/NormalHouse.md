> *"Your citizens will certainly appreciate a roof above their heads."*

The Basic House is the first basic building with housing for your citizens besides the Modern Rustic Home.

## Strategy

As it is cheap and unlocked from the beginning, the Basic House is essential for the early game. However, it is better to build houses with higher happiness values if you want your citizens to be happy.

The Living Research Center allows you to upgrade all basic homes to a different type, making it much easier to reach maximum home quality.
