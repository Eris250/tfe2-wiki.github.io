The Modern Rustic Home is a House in The Final Earth 2. Like the House, it is unlocked from the very start.

## Strategy

While this house is good, the low capacity means that you'll have to build lots of Modern Rustic Homes, which can eat away at your materials. However, with the right plan, it can be used as a cheap house that can be upgraded to be 100 happiness. Plan out your placing locations, which generally means building them in large blocks.

Even without placing it near other Modern Rustic Homes or Parks, it does provide significantly more happiness than a regular house. If you are well off in materials, this could be a way to slowly raise the happiness.

In endgames, Modern Rustic Homes aren't that useful as they don't really hold many people & have upgrades & special placing requirements, which can be disturbed by building underneath them. Better choices would be Alien House (if you're looking for something just as cheap), Community House (which can produce materials too), Tinkerer's Houses (extra education), Villas (which have teleporters).
