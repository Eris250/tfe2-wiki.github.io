## Step 2

Input the file name at the top (make sure to end it with .md) and start writing away! Files are written in **markdown**, so make sure you are familiar with
[the markdown format](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/)

## Step 3

After you have finished, make sure to describe what you changed. And make sure to use a better description than I did!

Make sure (if given the option) to **start a pull request**.

## Step 4

Now all you have to do is press the big green button at the bottom, and an admin will look over your changes and accept them!
