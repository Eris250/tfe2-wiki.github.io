House
The Basic House is the first basic building with housing for your citizens besides the Modern Rustic Home.

## Strategy

As it is cheap and unlocked from the beginning, the Basic House is essential for the early game. However, it is better to build houses with higher happiness values if you want your citizens to be happy.

The Living Research Center allows you to upgrade all basic homes to a different type, making it much easier to reach maximum home quality.

Alien House
The Alien House is a house in The Final Earth 2. It is unlocked by fully exploring an alien ruin.

## Strategy

Coming from a random discovery from alien ruins, Alien Houses are some of the best houses in the game, even rivaling the Villa. It houses an impressive number of people, is quite cheap, and can easily get 100 quality if you get the Living Research Center upgrades. However, make sure you have adequate food production, as your citizens can easily fall to starvation if you build too much of these.

Modern Rustic Home
The Modern Rustic Home is a House in The Final Earth 2. Like the House, it is unlocked from the very start.

## Strategy

While this house is good, the low capacity means that you'll have to build lots of Modern Rustic Homes, which can eat away at your materials. However, with the right plan, it can be used as a cheap house that can be upgraded to be 100 happiness. Plan out your placing locations, which generally means building them in large blocks.

Even without placing it near other Modern Rustic Homes or Parks, it does provide significantly more happiness than a regular house. If you are well off in materials, this could be a way to slowly raise the happiness.

In endgames, Modern Rustic Homes aren't that useful as they don't really hold many people & have upgrades & special placing requirements, which can be disturbed by building underneath them. Better choices would be Alien House (if you're looking for something just as cheap), Community House (which can produce materials too), Tinkerer's Houses (extra education), Villas (which have teleporters).
